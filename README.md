# 🚀 Machine Learning – Project

Welcome to my personal Machine Learning project repository! This space is dedicated to building end-to-end ML projects from scratch — applying everything I’ve learned so far and exploring new techniques along the way.

## 🌱 Why This Repository?

I created this repository to challenge myself beyond guided labs and tutorials. While I’m still learning, this is my sandbox for experimenting, building, and documenting real-world machine learning workflows — from data preprocessing to model evaluation and deployment.

## 📚 What to Expect

- ✅ Projects built entirely by me, step by step
- 📊 Clean and modular code with visualizations
- 🧠 Reflections on what worked, what didn’t, and what I learned
- 🔍 Evaluation metrics and performance tracking
- 🛠️ Continuous improvements as I grow

## 🧪 Current Focus

I'm actively learning and practicing core machine learning concepts through guided projects and lab exercises from the course I'm currently studying. So far, I've explored:

- ✅ Supervised Learning — understanding models like Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, SVM, and more
- ✅ Unsupervised Learning — working with clustering techniques and dimensionality reduction
- ✅ Evaluation Metrics — learning how to assess model performance across classification, regression, and clustering tasks

While I haven’t built my own end-to-end project yet, this repository is where I’ll start applying what I’ve learned to real-world problems — step by step, in 
my own way.

## ✨ Coming Soon

As I continue learning and gaining confidence, I plan to start building my own end-to-end machine learning projects from scratch. These upcoming additions will reflect my personal ideas, problem-solving approach, and creativity.

What’s on the horizon:

- 🧪 Self-framed Supervised & Unsupervised ML projects
- 🛠️ Feature engineering and data cleaning pipelines
- 📊 Evaluation dashboards to compare models and metrics
- 🚀 Deployment experiments using Flask or Streamlit
- 🗃️ SQL-powered data sourcing and integration
- 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with storytelling

This section will grow as I move from guided labs to independent, portfolio-worthy projects.

## 🙌 A Note to Visitors

This is a work in progress — not a showcase of perfection, but a reflection of growth. If you’re learning too, feel free to explore, fork, or share feedback. Let’s grow together!
